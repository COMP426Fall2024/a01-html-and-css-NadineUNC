        <h2>The Final Empire</h2>
        <p>
          This book has two big ideas for the plot. The first was
          that of a heist story, like Sneakers or Ocean’s Eleven involving a
          gang of gentlemen thieves who each had a distinctive magic power. It
          tells the story of how their different magics and abilities
          worked together for them to pull an incredible caper. The second idea
          was a story about a world where the good guys lost. It takes
          the standard fantasy story thet you have read a dozen times, that of a
          young peasant hero who went on a quest to defeat a Dark Lord, and turn
          it on its head. What if the Dark Lord won? What if, in the final
          climactic moments, he killed the hero and took over the world? Hence,
          Mistborn. A thousand years ago, the prophesied hero from lore rose up
          to overthrow a great and terrible evil. Only, he lost, and the Dark
          Lord took over and has been ruling with an iron fist for a thousand
          years. Ash falls from the sky in this barren land, and mists come
          every night, deep and mysterious. In this setting, a gang of thieves
          decides that the prophecies were all lies and that they can’t trust in
          some fabled hero to save them. They decide to take matters into their
          own hands, and plan a daring heist of the dark lord himself, planning
          to use the emperor’s own wealth to bribe his armies away from him and
          take over the empire.

        <h2>The Well Of Ascension</h2>
        <p>
          Book 2 of the Mistborn series was more about building
          something up, rather than tearing something down. Showing how this is an even more
          difficult task than than overthrowing an enemy. We begin this book
          with Elend Venture on the throne, and Kelsier’s former crew forming
          his most trusted advisors and government officials. The city is under
          siege from Straff Venture, Elend’s father, a vicious tyrant. In one
          sense, the novel is about Elend, Vin, and the rest of the team
          struggling with politics and armies as they try not to lose control of
          the city. The whole book builds on chapters and chapters of tension that lead up to the final battle 
          that you will be on the edge of your seat to read.

        <h2>The Hero Of Ages</h2>
        <p>
          This book is not only the third book in a trilogy, but it’s Act Three
          of the the three-act structure for the Mistborn Trilogy it’s the part
          of the story where the heroes have discovered that what they thought
          was the problem all along was not the true danger, and now they’re
          fighting for not only their own survival but that of the world they
          live in. The mists are killing people and staying out much longer than
          they should. The Ashmounts are spewing more and more choking ash into
          the sky, burying the crops that everyone needs to eat to live. And
          Ruin, the creature Vin was tricked into freeing from its prison of a
          millennium, is loose to wreak havoc upon the land. Life under the Lord
          Ruler is starting to look like paradise in comparison. While the first
          book in the trilogy turned the standard fantasy story on its head,
          this volume (perhaps inevitably?) returns in a way to the tropes the
          first volume was a reaction against. Yet in this case the enemy is not
          a human or humanlike Dark Lord, but something more like a force of
          nature—entropy itself given a will and a guiding personality in the
          form of Ruin. Ultimately, the book is about how the characters we have
          grown to love from the previous volumes—Vin, Elend, Sazed, TenSoon,
          Spook, Marsh, and others—find the courage and faith to fight on in the
          face of overwhelming odds, just as Kelsier taught them when he plotted
          the downfall of the Final Empire.
