        In the Mistborn world there is magic called Allmonancy. This magic
        allows an Allomancy to injest differnt metals to gain mythological
        abilities when they 'burn' the metal. There are 8 basic metals and 2
        higher metals. Each metal is paired with another metal meant as is
        compliment/oppisite. The 8 basic metals can then be grouped into
        physical or mental metals meaning they either affect the physical
        world or the mind.

              iron allows the user to pull the metals towords them instead of
              push.
